# Weather-Dashboard

# Description
This project was a first look at creating a dynamic page using web APIs. It allows the user to input a city and then the page is populated with data about todays weather as well as a 5-day forecast.  Cities that have been entered are also stored and displayed on the page allowing the user to also click on those cities to search them again.  

The hardest part about this project was understanding how and getting multiple API calls to run for different functionalities within the site.  The UV index was a different call that required the location of the city and that is provided in the first call to fill the weather. Also signing up for the service and getting an API key to work was the first challenge.

# Installation
Only require thing is to have a browser, this project will run completely within the browser.

# Usage
Usage of the site is very simple and straightfoward. Enter a city (and a country if wanted) and click the search button to get weather data.  Once something has been searched, the button that was created can be clicked to search for its city.  Clear button can also be clicked to clear the history of searches.
